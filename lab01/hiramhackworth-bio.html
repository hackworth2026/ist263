    Hiram Hackworth, I am an information technology/ management major interested in the implementation of A.I. in the workforce. I have completed a course in coding, JavaScript, and have taken a class in information security. Both courses offered valuable insight into the requirements to join into the technology field. When outside of school environment, I am an individual who likes to work out with friends, watch movies when free within the week, and explore the city looking at new places to shop at. Overall, I am a regular guy who likes the school that he is studying at, the city he resides in, and the friends he spends his time with.
